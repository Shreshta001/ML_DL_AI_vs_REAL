# 🔍 Detecting AI-Generated vs. Real Images

## 📜 Problem Statement

The rise of sophisticated AI techniques has made it possible to create highly realistic images that can be challenging to differentiate from actual photographs. This project aims to develop a **Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) model** that can accurately identify whether an image is **AI-generated** or **real**. Such models are crucial in various applications, including media verification, security, and content authenticity checks.
